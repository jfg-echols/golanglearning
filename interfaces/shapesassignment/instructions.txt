write a program that creats two custom types called square and triangle
-done
square should be a struct with field called side length type float64
-done
triangle should be a struct witha field called height (float64) and base (float64)
-done
both should have a function called getArea returns the calculated area of square and triangle
	-triangle = 0.5*base*height
	-square = length*length

add shape interface that defines a function called printArea
this function shuold calculate teh shape and print it out to the terminal. 
Design the interface so that printArea can be called with either triangle or square
