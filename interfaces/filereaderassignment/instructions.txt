create a program that reads the contentrs of a text file and then prints to terminal

the file to open should be provided as arg to the program when it is executed at the terminal
for example: go run main.go myfile.txt opens myfile.txt

to read the arguments provided to a program, you can reference 'os.Args' which is []stringformat

what interface does the 'File' type implement

if the 'File' type implements the 'reader' interface, you might be able to reuse that io.Copy function!
